# Indian-Road-Traffic-Analysis
India has one of the most complex and congested traffic conditions. The road system in India
reflects its population. The traffic conditions in India are constantly changing as cars, trucks,
motorcycles and auto rickshaws all use the roads. The growth of cities and improvements in
the economy have led to vehicles on the roads creating a complex situation.

Analysing traffic in India holds immense importance where the major cities in India are consistently among the most congested places all around the world. This congestion leads to air pollution, increased fuel consumption which is resulting in economic losses. 

The aim of this research is to analyse road traffic by utilising UAV images and advanced learning
methods. The main emphasis is on creating a system for identifying objects in pictures and
establishing a specialised labelled dataset.

The primary goal is to provide insights to aid in planning and traffic control ultimately
contributing to the advancement of intelligent and eco-friendly cities in India.
